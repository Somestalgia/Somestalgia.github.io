            <p class="terminal">...in a room. A classroom by the looks of it. There's like, 30 desks, you think, but counting is hard. There's
            a projector on, connected to a laptop. There's something in the search bar... https://tinyurl.com/hotbabesimulator. The character
            you are currently playing as is mildly intrigued by such a url, even if you aren't. There's also a teacher's desk, with a stack of
            papers on it. They're all white except for one, which is bright red. Weird.</p>
