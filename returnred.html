            <p class="terminal">...in a hallway. Back where you started. Delightful. There's a door to the right of you. Another door is on your left.
            You hear a sound like the whir of a fan coming from behind it. In front of you, the hallway seems to stretch on forever. You now notice that
            copies of that bright red paper cover the walls. How did you miss that before? You look behind you. The same seemingly infinite hallway
            stretches on, the papers littering the walls. Weird</p>
